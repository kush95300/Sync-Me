      <h1>About The Zoo</h1>
      <p>BCQ Zoo was established in 2001 by the Wildlife Conservation Trust. We have been in service for 18 years..</p>
      <p>At BCQ Zoo we aim to provide animals their basic rights and needs. We rescue animals from around the world and bring them to our zoo. The animals in our zoo are the ones that are not fit to be released back into the wild. They have been emotionally and physically harmed by poachers to the extent they cannot survive back out in the wild. </p>
      <p> We run on donations and revenue from advertisement and customer expenditure. Most of the animals in BCQ Zoo are airlifted from the African Continent to reduce time, effort, and discomfort. Usually, the cost of this is funded by government grants and economic support from Non-Profit Organizations. BCQ Zoo is also proud to announce that we also are a conservationist institution. We protect and save endangered animal species.</p>
      <p>We are a Zoo aimed at animals, not human entertainment. We urge our visitors to love animals, recycle items and consider social implications to the environment.</p>
